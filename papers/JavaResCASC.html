<h2>JavaRes v1.3</h2>

<h3>Architecture</h3>

JavaRes v1.3 [Pease2021] is a simple, resolution-based theorem prover, primarily
created for teaching theorem proving. It implements the
basic calculus from Robinson's seminal paper [Ro65], extended
with negative literal selection and some redundancy elimination as
described by Bachmair and Ganziner [BnG]. The core is a
given-clause based clausal saturation algorithm. The system also
supports full first-order input via clausification, and equality
handling via automatic addition of equality axioms.

</p><h3>Strategies</h3>

JavaRes includes all the optimization strategies in PyRes.  For clause
selection it implements two methods, which are combined.  The most
basic is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) strategy that will eventually try every
clause.  A symbol-counting strategy
picks the clause with the fewest symbols.  This results in a strong bias
to smaller clauses while ensuring that all clauses will eventually be
tried.

JavaRes supports indexing for subsumption and resolution.  Subsumption
removes clauses from the set of clauses to be processed (called
``forward subsumption'') and from the set already processed (``backwards
subsumption'') thereby decreasing the problem search space.  More
general clauses subsume more specific ones.

Indexing is used and employs
records with signs and predicate symbols only, so that potential clauses can
be accepted or rejected more rapidly than attempting unification.

JavaRes also implements PyRes' approach to literal selection.
Largest literal selection is the default strategy.

For large theories, JavaRes has implemented the SInE
algorithm [Hoder] although performance on the LTB problems
is so poor for this simple prover, compared to modern provers such as E
and Vampire that we do not enter JavaRes in that division.


<h3>Implementation</h3>

JavaRes is largely a re-implementation of PyRes, but in Java, and with
additional features that are not part of the core inference algorithm.
Additional features include implementation of SInE, parsing of SUO-KIF
syntax, graphical proof output using GraphViz.  The implementation is
designed to be straightforward and doesn't include any of the newer
Java language features such as lambda expressions.

<h3>Expected Competition Performance</h3>

JavaRes is faster than PyRes simply due to the implementation language.
It solves a few more problems than PyRes but is significantly faster on
problems that both provers solve.  It is inferior compared to most modern
superposition-based provers.
It is expected to perform reasonably well on problems without equality.
